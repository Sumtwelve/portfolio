                Hello! My name is Noah Nielsen. I'm a computer nerd who's ready to enter
                the professional world. I'm also a self-taught musician, but right now I'm
                just ready to keep that as a hobby :)</p>
            <p>
                I made this website to serve as a portfolio for my web development work,
                but also as a place where my friends can see the stuff I've made.
            </p>

                I believe technology has the power to make life easier and more enjoyable
                for everyone. I also believe everyone should be able to learn about tech
                and know how our modern world actually works.
            </p>
            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>
                Music and coding entered my life at about the same time, when I was 12.
                The year was 2011, and my parents gave me a Nintendo DSi for Christmas.
                I was ecstatic! Inspired by my older brother, I bought a little music-making
                game called Rytmik. It was just a sequencer with a bunch of synth-ish presets
                built in, but to me it was a place I could express myself and the songs that
                had been swirling around in my head since I was little.
            </p>
            <p>
                Somewhere within the same time period that I'd gotten my DSi, my best friend
                introduced me to the game <i>Minecraft</i>. Maybe I thought it was an
                entrancing game, but the best part about it was playing with him. Every idea
                he had he flawlessly executed, and I quickly fell in love with the experience.
                I became somewhat obsessed with the game. Everything about it or related to
                it was now my favorite thing. For example, Sweden became my favorite country,
                because even though I'd never been there, I knew that's where <i>Minecraft</i>'s
                creator was from. And as another example, a peculiar new word joined my
                vocabulary: <i>Java</i>. The 'programming language' the game was written in.
                I can't remember now what exactly pushed me to do it, but I started looking
                up Java tutorials online. Maybe I thought that if someone could write a game
                like <i>Minecraft</i> in Java, then I could make cool stuff too.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first major project didn't come about because of a coding challenge I'd
                found anywhere, but rather as a personal interest of mine. At the time, I
                was very interested in editing the game files of my copy
                of <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> for PC.

                After trying different varieties of music-making software, today I usually
                make music with Caustic 3 for Android, and Ableton Live on my laptop. Though
                I wouldn't call myself a prolific artist by any means, I'm quite happy with
                what I have managed to finish. You can click MUSIC up at the top there to
                peruse them :)
