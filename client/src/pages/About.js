            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Noah Nielsen. I'm a computer nerd who's ready to enter
                the professional world. I'm also a self-taught musician, but right now I'm
                just ready to keep that as a hobby :)</p>
            <p>
                I made this website to serve as a portfolio for my web development work,
                but also as a place where my friends can see the stuff I've made.
            </p>

                I believe technology has the power to make life easier and more enjoyable
                for everyone. I also believe everyone should be able to learn about tech
                and know how our modern world actually works.
            </p>
            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>
                Music and coding entered my life at about the same time, when I was 12.
                The year was 2011, and my parents gave me a Nintendo DSi for Christmas.
                I was ecstatic! Inspired by my older brother, I bought a little music-making
                game called Rytmik. It was just a sequencer with a bunch of synth-ish presets
                built in, but to me it was a place I could express myself and the songs that
                had been swirling around in my head since I was little.
            </p>
            <p>
                Somewhere within the same time period that I'd gotten my DSi, my best friend
                introduced me to the game <i>Minecraft</i>. It was an
                entrancing game, and I quickly fell in love with it. I learned everything I could
                about it. I found out its creator was from Sweden, so Sweden became my favorite
                country. And I found out that the game was written in a 'programming language'
                called <i>Java</i>. I can't remember now what exactly pushed me to do it, but
                I started looking up Java tutorials online. Maybe I thought that if someone
                could write a game like <i>Minecraft</i> in Java, then I could make cool
                stuff with it too.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first major project in Java, which also turned out to be the largest endeavor
                I'd ever undertaken, came about because of another obscure obsession I'd acquired.
                When I was about 13, I was very interested in messing with the game files of my
                copy of <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> for PC.
                It's an old game that doesn't bother hiding its inner workings, and I discovered
                you could actually edit the game's cutscenes! However, editing them manually in
                Notepad was very tedious. I wondered if I could write a program that would make
                it easier...
            </p>
            <p>
                That's what I set out to do: Create a text editor to facilitate hacking an
                11-year-old Harry Potter game. It proved far more difficult than those online
                Java tutorials could have really prepared me for, but I did the best I could
                with what I knew, and after 3 or so years of on-and-off work, and lots of
                face-to-face encounters with programmer's dread, I finally had it. My Harry
                Potter cutscene editor. It was (and still is) one of the proudest moments
                of my life. Not because I could finally hack this stupid game, but because
                I set my mind to something and actually accomplished it. That, I think, is
                why I love programming. It is extremely rewarding when you push through and
                figure something out, something you maybe thought you could never do.

                After trying different varieties of music-making software, today I usually
                make music with Caustic 3 for Android, and Ableton Live on my laptop. Though
                I wouldn't call myself a prolific artist by any means, I'm quite happy with
                what I have managed to finish. You can click MUSIC up at the top there to
                peruse them :)
